# SUPPLIER INTELLIGENCE V10 - THE COMPLETE ENGINE
## Merged Architecture: The "4-Layer Strategy" + "V7 Deep Data"

---

## 🚨 MASTER FILE DOCUMENTATION
**Status:** FINAL & COMPLETE
**Architecture:** Combines the high-level commercial strategy (The 4 Layers) with the granular data execution of V7 (Government, Financial, Compliance).
**Integrity Check:** NO DATA REMOVED. All V7 subsections are preserved and mapped to their strategic layer.

---

# STRATEGY LAYER 1: DISCOVERY & LEGITIMACY (The Foundation)
*Goal: Find every potential buyer and prove they exist.*

## 1.1 BASE DISCOVERY (From V7 Layer 1)
**Core Data Collection:**
- **Layer 1A (Profile):** Company Name, Domain, Industry, Description.
- **Layer 1C (Presence):** LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Etsy, Amazon Seller Profiles.
- **The "Unregistered" Sweep:**
  - *Logic:* Capture "Ghost" buyers (Etsy/Shopify stores without websites).
  - *Validation:* Cross-reference "Shop Name" with Google Business Profile to verify existence.

## 1.2 GOVERNMENT VERIFICATION (From V7 Layer 4A.1 & 4A.5)
**Source: Secretary of State & Business Registrations**
- **Data Points:**
  - Business Legal Name & DBAs (Doing Business As).
  - Status: Active / Dissolved / Suspended.
  - Incorporation Date (Age of business).
  - Registered Agent (Often the owner/decision maker).
  - Annual Report Filings (Proof of active management).
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Filters out "hobbyists" from "real businesses".
  - "Dissolved" status = Dead Lead (Don't call).
  - "Name Change" = Strategic Pivot (Rebranding opportunity).

## 1.3 COMPLIANCE & LICENSING (From V7 Layer 5C)
**Source: Business Licenses & Industry Certifications**
- **Subsection 5C.1: Business Licenses:**
  - Status: Active/Expired/Revoked.
  - Type: Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail.
  - *Signal:* License expiring in <3 months = Operational Risk.
- **Subsection 5C.2: Certifications:**
  - ISO 9001, ISO 14001, FEMA/HAZMAT.
  - *Signal:* ISO Certified = High Quality Buyer (expects premium packaging).
- **Subsection 5C.3: Inspections:**
  - OSHA/EPA/Health Dept records.
  - *Signal:* Clean record = Stable; Multiple violations = Distressed.

# STRATEGY LAYER 2: COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE (The Weapon)
*Goal: See exactly who they are buying from and where those relationships are failing.*

## 2.1 DIRECT COMPETITOR DISCOVERY (From V7 Layer 2)
**Mapping the Battlefield:**
- **Layer 2A:** Identify primary competitors via SEO keywords and product overlap.
- **Layer 2B:** Competitor Strength Scoring (Size, Reach, Dominance).

## 2.2 THE "SHADOW TRACKING" ENGINE (New & Enhanced)
**Source A: Import Data (Bill of Lading)**
- **Logic:** Match "Shipper" (Competitor) to "Consignee" (Buyer).
- **Data Points:**
  - Shipment Volume (How much are they buying?).
  - Shipment Frequency (Monthly? Quarterly?).
  - Weight/TEU (Proxy for spend).
- **Signal:** "Buyer X received 4 containers from Competitor Y last week."

**Source B: Review Mining (The "Broken Chain" Detector)**
- **Logic:** Monitor reviews on Google Maps, Trustpilot, BBB for specific Competitors.
- **Keywords:** "Late shipping", "Damaged boxes", "Poor quality", "Price increase".
- **Action:**
  - *IF* Competitor Y gets a 1-star review about "delayed packaging",
  - *THEN* Identify all Buyer X's using Competitor Y,
  - *EXECUTE* "Urgency Outreach" (Layer 4).

# STRATEGY LAYER 3: DERIVED DEMAND (Growth & Money)
*Goal: Predict they need packaging BEFORE they ask for it.*

## 3.1 REAL ESTATE & FACILITY INTEL (From V7 Layer 4A.3 & 5B)
**The "Physical Footprint" Proxy:**
- **Subsection 4A.3: Building Permits:**
  - *Signal:* "Expansion Permit" issued = 100% Certain Growth.
  - *Signal:* "New Equipment Foundation" = Capacity increase.
- **Subsection 5B.1: Commercial Property Data:**
  - Facility Square Footage (Estimate packaging volume: 10k sqft ≈ 50 boxes/week).
  - Property Value Assessment (+20% YoY = Growth).
- **Subsection 5B.2: Lease Data:**
  - *Signal:* Lease expiring in 6 months + Hiring = Moving to larger facility.
- **Subsection 5B.3: Utility Usage:**
  - *Signal:* Electricity/Water usage spike = Production ramp-up.

## 3.2 FINANCIAL HEALTH & CAPITAL (From V7 Layer 4A.4 & 5A)
**The "Ability to Pay" Proxy:**
- **Subsection 4A.4: UCC Filings:**
  - *Signal:* UCC filed for "Inventory" or "Equipment" = Secured Capital for Growth.
  - *Signal:* Refinancing = Cash flow management.
- **Subsection 5A.1: Credit Scores (D&B):**
  - PAYDEX 80+ = Reliable Payer (Green Flag).
  - PAYDEX <50 = Require Pre-payment (Red Flag).
- **Subsection 5A.2: SBA Loans:**
  - *Signal:* Recent 7(a) Loan = Growth Capital Injected.
  - *Signal:* 504 Loan = Real Estate/Equipment Acquisition.
- **Subsection 5A.3: Tax Filings:**
  - *Signal:* Tax Liens = Cash flow crisis (Extreme Urgency/Risk).

## 3.3 DIGITAL VELOCITY (From V7 Layer 3B & New Ads Logic)
**The "Sales Volume" Proxy:**
- **Ad Spend:** Spikes in Active Ads (FB/Google) = Expecting sales surge.
- **E-com Velocity:** "Best Seller" tag changes, "Low Stock" alerts.
- **Web Traffic:** +50% MoM traffic = +50% Packaging demand lag.

---

# STRATEGY LAYER 4: URGENCY & SCORING (The Action)
*Goal: Tell the supplier exactly WHO to call TODAY.*

## 4.1 RISK & DISTRESS SIGNALS (From V7 Layer 4A.2 & 4A.6)
**Source: Court & Regulatory Records**
- **Subsection 4A.2: Court Records:**
  - *Signal:* Bankruptcy (Ch 11) = Critical Risk / Restructuring Opportunity.
  - *Signal:* Judgments/Liens = Non-payment risk.
- **Subsection 4A.6: Environmental Violations:**
  - *Signal:* EPA/OSHA fines = Operational disruption risk.
