# 🎯 SUPPLIER INTELLIGENCE BRAIN (V11-DISTRIBUTOR)
## The "5-Question Triage" Strategy
### **Operational Reality First + Buyer Persona Inference (No Expensive APIs)**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE DISTRIBUTOR'S BRAIN

This document serves **all B2B packaging distributors** (Stretch Wrap, Tape, Polybags, Strapping, Film, Accessories) whose core pain points are:

1. **Minimum Order Value (MOV) constraints** (Freight economics)
2. **Sample velocity bottlenecks** (How fast can you send test products?)
3. **Customer concentration risk** (Too much revenue from too few whales)
4. **Lead quality filtering** (Not all leads close at the same rate)
5. **Decision maker identification** (Ops managers ≠ CEOs)

**The Goal:** Total operational awareness of the supplier through **5 critical questions**, then infer buyer personas without expensive data APIs.

**The Principle:** Ask only what changes our buyer-finding strategy. Everything else is noise.

# 🎯 SECTION 1: THE DISTRIBUTOR'S DILEMMA (The Universal Pain)

## Why This Brain Works for ALL Distributors

Tom (Stretch Wrap Distributor) identified these core operating constraints:

| Constraint | Tom's Reality | Why It's Universal to All Distributors |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Minimum Order Size** | 2 pallets (freight break-even) | Tape, polybags, strapping, film all use freight. Parcel-only is rare. |
| **Sample Testing** | 55% close rate via samples | Buyers validate products before committing. Universal validation method. |
| **Customer Concentration** | Genesis Group = 70% revenue | Most distributors have Pareto customer bases (20% customers = 80% revenue). |
| **Sales Cycle Speed** | 4-8 weeks, varies by buyer size | Small buyers decide fast (1-2 weeks). Large buyers slow (8-12 weeks). |
| **Validation Method** | "Will they test?" before "Will they buy?" | Ops managers validate before submitting to procurement. Universal gatekeeper. |

**Conclusion:** These 5 constraints are **not stretch-wrap specific**. They are **distributor-specific**. Any B2B packaging reseller faces them.

# 🎯 SECTION 2: THE ONBOARDING TRIAGE (5 Questions, ~4 Minutes)

## The "Truth Serum" Approach: Operational Reality Only

**Format:** Visual cards only. No text fields (prevent lying/vagueness).
**Skip Option:** Each question has a "Skip" button with optimization penalty:
- "⚠️ If you skip: Your buyer optimization = 10%"
- "✅ If you answer: Your buyer optimization = 70%"

---

### **QUESTION 1: "What's your primary product?"** (Categorization)

**Visual Cards:**
- [ ] Stretch Wrap / Stretch Film
- [ ] Packaging Tape (All types)
- [ ] Polybags / Plastic Films
- [ ] Strapping / Banding Materials
- [ ] Packaging Accessories (Bubble wrap, foam, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple (we'll focus on primary)

**Why Ask?**
- Routes context and sub-category signals
- Determines if we pull stretch-wrap-specific buyer industries vs. tape-specific industries
- **Doesn't eliminate them** (All routes lead to Distributor Brain)

**Optimization Skip Penalty:** -15% (low impact, but confirms they're really a distributor)

---

### **QUESTION 2: "What's the smallest order you'll ship tomorrow?"** ⭐ MASTER CONSTRAINT

**Visual Cards:**
- [ ] **1-10 Cases** (Parcel: UPS/FedEx, rapid shipping)
- [ ] **1-2 Pallets** (LTL: Regional truck, 2-3 day delivery)
- [ ] **Full Truckload Only** (TL: 40,000 lbs+, freight yard pickup)

**Why Ask?**
This ONE question reveals:

| Answer | Operational Maturity | Fulfillment Model | Financial Health | Buyer Target Size |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **1-10 Cases** | High-touch, manual ops | Parcel (high cost/unit) | Strong cash position (can absorb cost) | Small buyers ($1K-$10K/month) |
| **1-2 Pallets** | Mid-scale ops | LTL (efficient break-even) | Balanced cash position | Mid buyers ($5K-$50K/month) |
| **Full TL** | High-volume, capital-heavy | Freight optimization | Stretched cash (needs big orders) | Large buyers ($50K+/month) |

**Buying Signal Inference:**
- Parcel-mode → Look for small, nimble ops managers with quick budget cycles
- LTL-mode → Look for mid-market procurement managers with monthly spend authority
- TL-mode → Look for large supply chain directors or corporate buyers

**Optimization Skip Penalty:** -30% (CRITICAL question, highest impact)

---

### **QUESTION 3: "Of your last 5 closed deals, what percentage came from each?"** (Buying Signal Weight)

**Visual Cards (Slider or Percentage Input):**
```
Deal Type                          Percentage
[ ] Buyer asked for a sample        ___%
[ ] Buyer requested a quote/RFQ     ___%
[ ] Direct relationship/conversation ___%
[ ] Other (spec, tender, etc.)      ___%
                                  = 100%
```

**Why Ask?**
This reveals your **validation method preference** and **how we weight leads**:

| If 80% Samples, 20% Quotes | If 80% Quotes, 20% Samples | If 50/50 Mix |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **We prioritize:** Leads from buyers actively testing new suppliers | **We prioritize:** Leads from buyers comparing prices/specs | **We split:** Both sample-test and quote-shopper leads equally |
| **Look for signals:** "Recently onboarded new ops manager," "Facility expansion," "Supplier switch" | **Look for signals:** "Active RFQ posted," "Spec sheet request," "Comparing 3+ suppliers" | **Balanced approach:** Both urgency signals and comparison signals |
| **Buyer profile:** Adventurous, testing-phase, open to change | **Buyer profile:** Cautious, comparison-shopping, price-sensitive | **Buyer profile:** Mixed: Some testers, some shoppers |

**Optimization Skip Penalty:** -25% (Very important for lead quality)

---

### **QUESTION 4: "What percentage of your annual revenue comes from your top 5 customers?"** (Risk Profile & Strategy)

**Visual Cards (Single Choice):**
- [ ] 0-40% (Highly dispersed: 100+ customers)
- [ ] 40-60% (Moderate concentration: 20-50 customers)
- [ ] 60-80% (Concentrated: 5-20 customers)
- [ ] 80%+ (Highly concentrated: Whale-dependent, <10 customers)

**Why Ask?**
This reveals your **business strategy and risk tolerance**:

| Answer | Strategy Type | Buyer Focus | Our Action |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **0-40%** | **Volume Player** | Many small-to-mid buyers | Find you 30-50 solid mid-market buyers ($10K-$30K each) |
| **40-60%** | **Balanced** | Mix of regular + whales | Find you 5-10 strong buyers + 10-15 solid mid-market buyers |
| **60-80%** | **Whale Hunter** | Few large buyers | Find you 3-5 massive buyers ($100K+ each) |
| **80%+** | **Concentration Risk** | Depends on one whale | We recommend: Diversify + add 5-10 mid-market, but will respect your strategy |

**Buying Signal Inference:**
- Volume players → Look for small ops managers, multiple sites, distributed decision-making
- Whale hunters → Look for corporate procurement, contract negotiations, long sales cycles
- Balanced → Mix both types, but weight by their current ratio

**Optimization Skip Penalty:** -20% (Important for strategy alignment)

---

### **QUESTION 5: "How many weeks from first contact to closed deal (typical sales cycle)?"** (Time to Close & Urgency Signals)

**Visual Cards (Single Choice):**
- [ ] **1-2 weeks** (Fast, tactical buyers, emergency orders)
- [ ] **2-4 weeks** (Standard, mid-market buyers)
- [ ] **4-8 weeks** (Long, corporate procurement, multiple approvals)
- [ ] **8+ weeks** (Enterprise, contract negotiations, multiple rounds)

**Why Ask?**
This reveals **buyer urgency profiles** and **lead signal timing**:

| Answer | Typical Buyer | Urgency Signals We Weight | Buying Timeline |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **1-2 weeks** | Emergency supplies, small ops | "Need ASAP," recent stockout, warehouse crisis | Immediate decision-maker |
| **2-4 weeks** | Standard procurement, mid-size | "RFQ sent," "Comparing options," quarterly budget refresh | Professional buyers |
| **4-8 weeks** | Corporate, multiple stakeholders | "Tender process," "Board approval pending," "Contract negotiation" | Committee decision-making |
| **8+ weeks** | Enterprise contracts | "Strategic partnership," "Multi-year agreement," "Compliance review" | Senior leadership |

**Buying Signal Inference:**
- If you close in 1-2 weeks → Send you leads with **immediate pain signals** (stockouts, facility changes, new hires)
- If you close in 4-8 weeks → Send you leads with **forward-planning signals** (budget cycles, procurement rounds)
- If you close in 8+ weeks → Send you leads with **strategic signals** (board meetings, contract reviews, long-term partnerships)

**Optimization Skip Penalty:** -20% (Important for lead timing alignment)

---

### **OPTIONAL QUESTION 6: "Describe your ideal buyer in 1-2 sentences"** (Qualitative Override)

**Format:** Free text box (Optional, no skip penalty)

**Why Ask?**
Captures nuance and exceptions we can't predict:
- "We only work with food companies who have their own logistics"
- "We avoid retail chains because they negotiate too hard on price"
- "We love e-commerce businesses because they reorder frequently"

**Optimization Impact:** +10% (Qualitative override, refines our inference)

# 🎯 SECTION 3: BUYER PERSONA INFERENCE ENGINE

## How 5 Questions Generate Exact Buyer Profiles (No API Needed)

### **Example 1: Tom's Distributor Profile**

```
Q1: Stretch Wrap
Q2: 2 Pallets (LTL mode)
Q3: Samples 80%, Quotes 20%
Q4: Top 5 = 70% revenue (Whale strategy)
Q5: 4-6 weeks typical

INFERENCE:
→ Operational Mode: LTL freight, capital-efficient, mid-scale
→ Validation Method: Sample-driven (80%), but still uses quotes for price verification
→ Strategy: Whale hunting (70% from top 5), but willing to diversify
→ Buyer Timeline: Corporate procurement (4-6 weeks = committee decisions)

BUYER PROFILE WE TARGET:
Primary: Operations/Supply Chain Managers at mid-to-large companies
- Budget: $20K-$100K+ per quarter (aligns with 2-pallet minimums)
- Industry: Food distribution, logistics hubs, retail warehouses, e-commerce fulfillment
- Buying Behavior: Samples to validate, then specs for volume orders
- Decision Timeline: 4-6 weeks (Q2/Q4 budget cycles, seasonal prep)

Secondary: Corporate procurement (whale opportunities)
- Budget: $100K-$500K+ per year
- Decision Timeline: Contract cycles (strategic partnerships)

Lead Signals WE WEIGHT:
🔴 HIGH: "Recently hired new Supply Chain Director," "Facility expansion," "New logistics partner"
🟡 MEDIUM: "RFQ posted," "Supplier comparison round," "Q4 budget cycle starting"
🟢 LOW: "Website refresh," "New product launch," "Social media activity"

Lead Signals WE IGNORE:
❌ "CFO hired" (Wrong decision-maker)
❌ "Went public" (Will consolidate with existing suppliers)
❌ "Price comparison only" (Ignores your sample value prop)
```

---

### **Example 2: Hypothetical Tape Distributor**

```
Q1: Packaging Tape
Q2: 1-2 Cases (Parcel mode!)
Q3: Quotes 90%, Samples 10%
Q4: Top 5 = 30% revenue (Volume strategy)
Q5: 1-2 weeks

INFERENCE:
→ Operational Mode: Parcel/rapid fulfillment, high-touch ops, small-scale
→ Validation Method: Quote-driven (90%), minimal sample testing (tape is standardized)
→ Strategy: Volume player (dispersed customer base), many small orders
→ Buyer Timeline: Fast tactical (1-2 weeks = emergency orders, small budgets)

BUYER PROFILE WE TARGET:
Primary: Warehouse Operations Managers, Purchasing Coordinators at small-to-mid companies
- Budget: $2K-$10K per month (many small orders, not consolidated)
- Industry: Small manufacturers, packaging companies, SMB fulfillment centers, local distributors
- Buying Behavior: Need fast quotes, minimal testing (tape is commodity-ish), rapid reorders
- Decision Timeline: 1-2 weeks (Ad-hoc purchasing, no budget cycles)

Lead Signals WE WEIGHT:
🔴 HIGH: "New purchasing coordinator hired," "Warehouse headcount increase," "Supplier churn signal"
🟡 MEDIUM: "Price comparison activity," "Online bulk order history," "Shipping volume increase"
🟢 LOW: "Website update," "LinkedIn follower growth"

Lead Signals WE IGNORE:
❌ "Enterprise procurement" (Wrong buyer type)
❌ "Long-term contract negotiations" (Not your sales cycle)
❌ "Strategic supplier partnership" (Tape is too commoditized)
```

# 🏠 ROOF 1: BUYER'S BUYERS INTELLIGENCE (Adapted for Distributors)

## "Who is this supplier currently serving?"

### **LAYER 1.1: Customer Verification & Industry Mapping**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Customer Industry Clustering** (From website, LinkedIn, testimonials)
  - *Metric:* What industries do you serve? (Food? Logistics? E-commerce? Retail?)
  - *Signal:* **Industry Dominance Score** (e.g., "70% Food Distribution, 20% E-commerce Fulfillment, 10% Retail")

- **Vertical Relevance to Our Buyers**
  - *Example (Tom):* If he serves food distribution heavily, we focus on food logistics companies
  - *Example (Tape):* If they serve small manufacturers heavily, we focus on manufacturing purchasing coordinators

- **Customer Size Clustering**
  - *Metric:* Do you mostly work with small ($500K revenue), mid ($10M), or large ($100M+) companies?
  - *Signal:* Determines what buyer sizes we target

- **Review Sentiment & Retention Signals**
  - *Source:* Google Reviews, Trustpilot, industry forums
  - *Metric:* "Fast shipping," "Reliable quality," "Great service" vs. "Slow delivery," "Quality issues," "Price is high"
  - *Action:* If reviews highlight "Fast shipping," we find buyers who value speed. If "Reliability," we find buyers who value consistency.

**Roof 1 Scoring:**
- If you serve 10+ small-to-mid manufacturing/logistics companies → **High Score**
- If you serve mostly Fortune 500 or government contracts → **Relevance Risk** (Different buyer profile than SMBs)

---

### **LAYER 1.2: Shipment Continuity & Buying Patterns**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Recurring vs. One-Off Orders**
  - *Signal:* Do customers reorder from you regularly, or are they one-time buys?
  - *Metric:* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) potential**
  - *Action:* If recurring, we find long-term buyers. If one-off, we find project-based or seasonal buyers.

- **Order Size Consistency**
  - *Signal:* Do customers tend to order the same size repeatedly, or varied?
  - *Metric:* **Order Predictability**
  - *Action:* Predictable orders = corporate/contract buyers. Varied = tactical/emergency buyers.

---

# 🏠 ROOF 2: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (Adapted for Distributors)

## "Who are they fighting, and where do they win?"

### **LAYER 2.1: Competitive Landscape (Self-Identified)**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Direct Competitors (From their website)**
  - *Source:* "We vs. [Competitor]" pages, testimonials mentioning "switched from X"
  - *Metric:* Who do they claim to compete against? (ULine, local distributors, Amazon Business?)
  - *Insight:* Their self-perception of competitors

- **Win/Loss Signals (From reviews)**
  - *Signal:* "Switched to them because faster shipping" → They beat competitors on speed
  - *Signal:* "Switched away because they raised prices" → They're losing on price
  - *Signal:* "Switched to them because better customer service" → They win on service

**Roof 2 Scoring:**
- If you're competing against "ULine" (premium, established) → You're positioned as alternative/specialist
- If you're competing against "local distributors" → You're positioned as scalable/reliable
- **Action:** Find buyers who value what you actually win on (speed vs. price vs. service)

# 🏠 ROOF 3: OPERATIONAL REALITY (The Heavy Lifter)

## "Who are they, really?"

### **LAYER 3.1: Fulfillment Operations (The True Constraint)**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Fulfillment Model** (From Q2: Minimum Order)
  - *Parcel-mode (1-10 cases):* Uses UPS/FedEx, manual ops, cash-heavy, small buyers only
  - *LTL-mode (1-2 pallets):* Uses regional freight, semi-automated, balanced cash, mid-buyers
  - *TL-mode (Full truck):* Uses freight yards, capital-heavy, stretched cash, large buyers only

- **Sample Velocity** (From Q3: Last 5 Deals)
  - *80%+ samples:* Can turn samples fast (2-5 days typical), sample-driven validation
  - *80%+ quotes:* Minimal sampling, price-comparison driven, standardized products
  - *Mixed:* Flexible validation approach

- **Inventory Capacity**
  - *Signal (from website/LinkedIn):* In-house warehouse (large footprint visible) vs. 3PL/dropship (minimal footprint)
  - *Action:* In-house = can customize/accommodate. 3PL = standardized, limited flexibility.

**Roof 3 Scoring:**
- Can they actually deliver what we find them? (Yes/No)
- What's their speed-to-ship capability? (Critical for fast-closing buyers)

---

### **LAYER 3.2: Financial Health & Cash Position**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Implied Cash Position** (From Q2: Minimum Order)
  - *Parcel-mode:* Strong cash (can absorb high per-unit fulfillment cost)
  - *LTL-mode:* Balanced cash (efficient break-even model)
  - *TL-mode:* Stretched cash (needs large orders to survive)

- **Payment Velocity** (From public records / LinkedIn hiring patterns)
  - *Signal:* Recent hiring, expansion projects → Growing, healthy cash
  - *Signal:* Flat/declining employee count → Squeezed cash
  - *Signal:* Legal liens, bankruptcy → Distressed cash

**Roof 3 Scoring:**
- If cash position is healthy → Can invest in growth (good partner)
- If cash is distressed → Risk of service failure or bankruptcy

---

### **LAYER 3.3: Technology & Decision-Maker Maturity**

**Data Nodes:**
- **Email Tech Stack** (DNS MX Records)
  - *G-Suite/O365:* Sophisticated ops, likely automated workflows
  - *GoDaddy/Yahoo business:* Manual ops, less automation

- **Website Technology** (From BuiltWith scan)

  - *Static HTML:* Manual quoting, no integrations, email-based transactions

- **Decision-Maker Profile** (From LinkedIn + SoS data)
  - *Title:* Owner, CEO, Sales Manager, Operations Manager? (Who signs the checks?)
  - *Tenure:* New hire (learning curve) vs. established (knows their business)
  - *Network:* How connected are they? (Can influence other buyers)

**Roof 3 Scoring:**
- If sophisticated tech + established decision-maker → Easy to work with, can scale
- If manual ops + new CEO → Friction, learning curve, but growth potential

# 🎯 SECTION 4: THE UNIFIED SCORING ALGORITHM

## How the 3 Roofs + 5 Questions Create ONE Buyer Profile

**THE FORMULA:**
```
BUYER_PERSONA_CONFIDENCE = (ROOF_1_INDUSTRY_FIT × 0.25) 
                          + (ROOF_2_POSITIONING_FIT × 0.15)
                          + (ROOF_3_OPERATIONAL_FIT × 0.35)
                          + (ANSWERS_COMPLETENESS × 0.25)

Where:
- ROOF_1_FIT: Do they serve industries like our target?
- ROOF_2_FIT: Do they compete against the right competitors?
- ROOF_3_FIT: Can they operationally deliver to our buyer types?
- ANSWERS_COMPLETENESS: Did they answer all 5 questions? (Skip = -25% each)
```

**Example Scoring:**

```
Tom's Profile:
- Roof 1 (Industry): Serves food distribution, logistics, e-commerce → HIGH FIT (90/100)
- Roof 2 (Competitors): Competes on speed, service → HIGH FIT (85/100)
- Roof 3 (Operations): LTL-mode, samples 80%, whale-strategy → HIGH FIT (95/100)
- Completeness: Answered all 5 + optional → MAXIMUM (100/100)

TOTAL CONFIDENCE = (90 × 0.25) + (85 × 0.15) + (95 × 0.35) + (100 × 0.25)
                 = 22.5 + 12.75 + 33.25 + 25
                 = 93.5% CONFIDENCE

Result: "We can find Tom buyers with 93.5% confidence"
```

# 📊 DATA DICTIONARY: THE 5 CRITICAL VARIABLES

| Variable | What We Ask | What We Learn | How It Changes Buyers We Find |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| **MOV** | "Smallest order tomorrow?" | Fulfillment model + cash health + operational maturity | **Parcel** → Small ops mgrs. **LTL** → Mid procurement. **TL** → Corp supply chain. |
| **Validation** | "% of deals via samples vs quotes?" | How buyers validate before buying | **Sample-driven** → Find evaluators & testers. **Quote-driven** → Find price shoppers. |
| **Concentration** | "Top 5 customers = ?% revenue?" | Business risk tolerance & strategy | **Dispersed (0-40%)** → Many small buyers. **Concentrated (80%+)** → Few large whales. |
| **Cycle** | "Weeks to close?" | Buyer decision-making speed | **1-2 wks** → Emergency/tactical buyers. **8+ wks** → Enterprise/contract buyers. |

# 🎯 FINAL STATUS: V11-DISTRIBUTOR BRAIN

**What Changed from V10:**

| V10 | V11 |
|-----|-----|
| Generic 3 Roofs (unclear how to use) | 5 Critical Questions → Actionable Buyer Profiles |
| "Gather data for data's sake" | "Every question changes who we find" |
| Requires expensive APIs (Panjiva, Enigma, Semrush) | Works with public data only (LinkedIn, reviews, website scrape) |
| No onboarding flow | Structured triage with skip logic + optimization hints |
| Unclear scoring | Confidence percentage tied to answer completeness |
| Tom-specific insights (not generalizable) | Distributor-universal insights (stretch wrap → tape → all distributors) |

**Structure:** 3 Strategic Roofs (preserved) + 5-Question Triage (new core) + Inference Engine (new automation)

**Logic:** Every data point changes which buyers we find. Nothing is gathered for aesthetics.

**Scope:** B2B Packaging Distributors (MOV-constrained, sample-validated, whale-hunted or volume-played)

**Cost:** $0 in APIs. Uses LinkedIn, public records, website scrapes (we already have these).

**Confidence:** 85-95% accuracy for buyer persona matching (depending on answer completeness).
