# 🧠 SUPPLIER CONTEXT BRAIN - V10 COMPLETE
## Intelligence Layer Decision Engine
### **Determines WHAT data to pull for EACH supplier type (Not WHETHER to work with them)**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Brain is NOT a gatekeeper. The Brain is a **strategic intelligence optimizer**.

**Core Principle:** All suppliers are welcome on the platform. The Brain decides:
1. **WHAT intelligence layers** are relevant for THIS supplier's success?
2. **WHAT buyer profile** should we infer for them?
3. **WHAT deal size** should we target (MOV → 5-10x AOV)?
4. **HOW MUCH revenue impact** can we realistically create?
5. **WHAT should we charge** based on the value we deliver?

---

# SECTION 1: SUPPLIER CLASSIFICATION ENGINE
## "What kind of supplier is this?" (Not "Should we work with them?")

### **Classification Categories (Not Tiers, Not Rejection Criteria)**

Every supplier fits into one of these profiles. Classification determines intelligence strategy, not acceptance.

---

## CATEGORY A: THE ESTABLISHED PLAYER ($400K - $10M ARR)
### *Large existing customer base + established operations*

**Profile Signals:**
- ARR: $400K - $10M+
- Monthly customers: 5-50+
- Website: Professional, multi-page
- Team size: 5-100+ employees (from LinkedIn)
- Operations: Established manufacturing/fulfillment facility
- Tech stack: E-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, custom)
- Financial health: PAYDEX 70+, no recent liens

**Why They're Here:**
- They're already generating revenue
- They have proven buyer relationships
- Scaling is their bottleneck, not survival
- They can afford premium service pricing

**Brain Decision: WHAT Intelligence to Pull?**

✅ **FULL STACK (All Roof 1, 2, 3 layers)** because:
- Their buyer base is proven → Roof 1 data validates current market strength
- Their competitive position is established → Roof 2 data shows where they fit
- Their capacity matters → Roof 3 tells us scaling potential

**Intelligence Layers Needed:**

| Layer | Why Relevant | What We Pull |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Roof 1: Customer Base** | Validate EXISTING buyer strength | Import/export volume, review sentiment, vertical dominance |
| **Roof 2: Market Position** | Understand competitive context | SEO keyword overlap, win/loss signals, pricing position |
| **Roof 3: Operations** | Assess scaling capacity | Facility size, hiring trends, financial health, growth capital |

**Decision Logic:**
If they have $400K+ ARR + 5+ monthly customers = **Pull everything. Their data is valuable.**

---

## CATEGORY B: THE GROWTH-STAGE OPERATOR ($100K - $500K ARR)
### *Early product-market fit + growing but not yet optimized*

**Profile Signals:**
- ARR: $100K - $500K
- Monthly customers: 2-10
- Website: Basic but functional (WordPress, Wix, custom)
- Team size: 2-10 employees
- Operations: Single facility, likely owner-operated
- Tech stack: Basic e-commerce or manual order management
- Financial health: PAYDEX 60-80 (paying but sometimes slow)

**Why They're Here:**
- They've found a buyer base but haven't optimized it
- They have cash flow (not pre-revenue survival mode)
- Scaling is both opportunity AND challenge
- They're profitable enough to invest in growth tools

**Brain Decision: WHAT Intelligence to Pull?**

✅ **SELECTIVE STACK (Roof 1 + Roof 3, lighter on Roof 2)** because:
- Their buyer base is REAL but small → Roof 1 validates WHO they're serving
- Their capacity is constrained → Roof 3 shows WHERE the ceiling is
- Their competition is less relevant → Roof 2 is lower priority (they're not competing on SEO yet)

**Intelligence Layers Needed:**

| Layer | Why Relevant | What We Pull |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Roof 1: Customer Base** | Small but proven → CRITICAL | Client logos, reviews, import/export volume |
| **Roof 2: Market Position** | Emerging, less relevant → OPTIONAL | Basic keyword overlap, pricing strategy |
| **Roof 3: Operations** | Constrained capacity → CRITICAL | Facility size, hiring needs, financial health |

**Decision Logic:**
If they have $100K-$500K ARR + 2-10 monthly customers = **Pull Roof 1 + 3 focus. Skip competitive depth.**

---

## CATEGORY C: THE SPECIALIST ($50K - $200K ARR)
### *Niche dominance + high-touch operations*

**Profile Signals:**
- ARR: $50K - $200K
- Monthly customers: 1-5
- Website: Niche-focused (may be basic design)
- Team size: 1-3 employees (often owner)
- Operations: Specialized process (hand-made, custom, rare materials)
- Tech stack: Minimal (Email + manual CRM)
- Financial health: Volatile (feast/famine cycles)

**Why They're Here:**
- They serve an underserved niche
- High margin but low volume
- Growth comes from better positioning, not volume scaling
- They're cash-flow constrained but highly skilled

**Brain Decision: WHAT Intelligence to Pull?**

✅ **FOCUSED STACK (Roof 1 + Selective Roof 3)** because:
- Their buyer base is hyper-niche → Roof 1 shows WHAT niche they own
- Their operations are specialized → Roof 3 shows capacity but NOT facility size (it's irrelevant)
- Their competition is minimal → Roof 2 is nearly irrelevant

**Intelligence Layers Needed:**

| Layer | Why Relevant | What We Pull |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Roof 1: Customer Base** | Niche validation → CRITICAL | Client testimonials, case studies, vertical dominance |
| **Roof 2: Market Position** | No competition to track → SKIP | Skip this entirely |
| **Roof 3: Operations** | Niche operations → SELECTIVE | Tech stack, decision makers, financial health (skip facility size) |

**Decision Logic:**
If they have <$200K ARR + 1-5 monthly customers + highly specialized = **Pull Roof 1 only. Skip scale metrics.**

---

## CATEGORY D: THE EMERGING OPERATOR ($10K - $100K ARR)
### *Pre-product-market fit or just launching*

**Profile Signals:**
- ARR: $10K - $100K
- Monthly customers: <2
- Website: Minimal or launch-focused
- Team size: 1 (often solo founder)
- Operations: Just starting, home-based or small space
- Tech stack: None (or Shopify free tier)
- Financial health: No business credit yet (too early)

**Why They're Here:**
- They're testing viability
- They're learning their buyer profile
- Scaling is secondary to validation
- They can't afford premium services

**Brain Decision: WHAT Intelligence to Pull?**

✅ **MINIMAL STACK (Roof 1 only, founder context)** because:
- Their buyer base is experimental → Roof 1 tells us if they've found ANYTHING that works
- Their operations are too new to assess → Roof 3 is mostly irrelevant
- Their market position doesn't exist yet → Roof 2 is irrelevant

**Intelligence Layers Needed:**

| Layer | Why Relevant | What We Pull |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Roof 1: Customer Base** | Validation → CRITICAL | Early testimonials, beta customers, product fit |
| **Roof 2: Market Position** | N/A → SKIP | Skip entirely |
| **Roof 3: Operations** | Irrelevant at this stage → SKIP | Skip entirely |

**Decision Logic:**
If they have <$100K ARR + <2 monthly customers = **Pull ONLY founder context + early buyer validation. Everything else is premature.**

---

# SECTION 2: BUYER PROFILE INFERENCE ENGINE
## "Who should we target as buyers for THIS supplier?"

### **Core Principle: Infer, Don't Ask**

We will determine their ideal buyer profile from the data we pull. We DO NOT ask them "What's your target customer?" because:
1. They often don't know (or give generic answers)
2. Their actual buyers tell us the truth (import/export, reviews, case studies)
3. We can infer from their product, pricing, and existing customers

---

## BUYER PROFILE INFERENCE FRAMEWORK

### **Data Sources for Inference:**

**From Roof 1 (Customer Base):**
- Client logos (NAICS codes reveal industry)
- Case studies (reveal use cases and buyer size)
- Reviews (reveal pain points and buyer types)
- Import/export data (reveal actual B2B customers)
- Portfolio images (reveal product types)

**From Website Signals:**
- Pricing page (indicates price sensitivity)
- Product descriptions (indicate buyer sophistication level)
- Sales copy tone (indicates buyer decision-maker level)
- FAQ section (reveals actual buyer questions)

**From Market Data (Roof 2):**
- Competitor's buyers (if they target same keywords, they target same buyers)
- Review sentiment keywords ("fast shipping", "quality", "cost" reveals buyer priorities)

### **Inference Model:**

**Step 1: Identify Current Buyer Profile**
```
IF import/export data shows:
  - Consignees in Food & Beverage + Retail
  - Average order: $3,000-$5,000
  - Frequency: Monthly
THEN inferred buyer profile:
  - Industry: Food & Beverage or Consumer Goods
  - Company size: SMB ($1M-$25M revenue)
  - Decision maker: Operations Manager or Procurement
  - Buying pattern: Recurring monthly orders
  - Price sensitivity: Medium (willing to pay for quality)
```

**Step 2: Identify Underserved Buyer Profiles (Expansion Targets)**
```
IF their case studies show:
  - 80% Retail buyers, 20% Food & Beverage
AND their SEO keywords include:
  - "cosmetics packaging", "beauty box supplies"
BUT import/export shows NO cosmetics buyers
THEN opportunity:
  - Target cosmetics SMBs (underserved vertical)
  - They have the product capability
  - Market gap exists
```

**Step 3: Estimate Buyer Sophistication Level**
```
IF their website tech stack = Shopify + Stripe + Email marketing:
  - Buyer profile = B2B + B2C (they handle both)
  - Buyer sophistication = Medium (self-service buyers)
  - Decision cycle = Fast (online ordering)

IF their website tech stack = Static HTML + phone orders:
  - Buyer profile = Enterprise/Large B2B only
  - Buyer sophistication = High (needs complex customization)
  - Decision cycle = Slow (requires sales calls)
```

# SECTION 3: DEAL SIZE CALCULATION ENGINE
## "What range of deals should we target for THIS supplier?"

### **Core Principle: MOV → 5-10x AOV, Not Chasing Unrealistic Deals**

We DON'T tell them: "Target $100K deals."
We DO tell them: "We found buyers from $2K (MOV) to $15-20K (5-10x AOV)."

---

## DEAL SIZING ALGORITHM

### **Step 1: Determine Their Minimum Order Value (MOV)**

**How we find MOV (without asking):**

- **From pricing page:** If they show "Starting at $2,000," that's MOV.
- **From Roof 1 data:** Import/export volume tells us smallest order sizes.
- **From reviews:** "My first order was $X" reveals MOV.
- **From LinkedIn job postings:** "Account executive - handle orders $2K+" reveals MOV.
- **Default estimate:** For packaging SMBs, typical MOV = $2,000-$5,000

### **Step 2: Determine Their Average Order Value (AOV)**

**How we calculate AOV (without asking directly):**

**Formula:**
```
AOV = (Estimated Monthly Revenue) / (Estimated Monthly Orders)
```

**Estimated Monthly Revenue:**
```
IF ARR = $1,500,000
THEN Monthly Revenue = $1,500,000 / 12 = $125,000/month
```

**Estimated Monthly Orders:**
```
We infer from:
1. LinkedIn: "Serves 50+ SMB customers" = ~10-20 new orders/month
2. Review velocity: "200 reviews last 30 days" on marketplace = High volume
3. Capacity signals: 50K sqft facility = Can handle 100+ orders/month
4. Conservative estimate: 5-20 orders/month (for B2B packaging)
```

**Example:**
```
Supplier: Mid-size packaging company
ARR: $1,500,000
Monthly Revenue: $125,000
Estimated Monthly Orders: 12 (1 per customer × 12 key accounts)

AOV = $125,000 / 12 = $10,417 per order
```

### **Step 3: Calculate Deal Size Range**

**Formula:**
```
MIN_DEAL = MOV (as is)
OPTIMAL_DEAL = AOV (sweet spot, proven working)
MAX_DEAL = AOV × 5 to 10 (stretch goal, not risky)
```

**Example with $10,417 AOV:**
```
MOV = $2,500 (starting point)
OPTIMAL = $10,417 (what they're already closing)
MAX = $10,417 × 7 = $72,919 (aggressive but not unrealistic)

Target deal range: $2,500 → $10,417 → $72,919
PRACTICAL strategy: Focus 70% on $8K-$12K (near AOV), 20% on $5K-$8K (volume play), 10% on $15K+ (upmarket push)
```

### **Step 4: Address the "Can We Find $100K Deals?" Question**

**YES, but with caveat:**

```
IF supplier asks: "Can you find me $100K deals?"

OUR ANSWER:
"Your AOV is $10,417. 
$100K deals are 9.6x your AOV.
 Yes, we CAN find them, but here's the reality:

- They're rare (maybe 1-2 per year, not monthly)
- Your sales team isn't built for them (they usually require custom engineering)
- We should focus on 20-30x $10K deals (more predictable, same revenue)
- THEN we'll explore $50K-$100K opportunities as your team scales

Our recommendation: 
Target $2,500 → $75,000 range. 
Most revenue comes from $8K-$12K orders (your strength).
Upsell to $30K+ once relationship is established.
Don't chase $100K and ignore the $5K deals that come easy."
```

# SECTION 4: REVENUE IMPACT CALCULATION ENGINE
## "How much revenue can we realistically create for them?"

### **Core Principle: Better Buyers > More Leads**

We don't measure success by "leads delivered."
We measure success by "revenue created."

---

## REVENUE IMPACT MODEL

### **Step 1: Determine Their Current Lead Flow & Close Rate**

**How we infer (without direct asking, but we verify during onboarding):**

**Current monthly customers:** From Roof 1 data (LinkedIn, import/export, reviews)
```
Estimate: They acquire 1-5 new customers per month
(varies by category: Established = 5-20, Growth-stage = 2-5, Specialist = 1-2)
```

**Close rate:** From industry benchmarks + their website signals
```
Default assumption: 10% close rate (meaning 10 leads → 1 customer)
Range: 5% (complex B2B) to 20% (simple e-commerce)
```

**Implied lead flow:**
```
IF current customers per month = 3
AND assumed close rate = 10%
THEN implied leads per month = 3 / 0.10 = 30 leads/month
```

### **Step 2: Define Our Value Proposition to THEM**

**We're not saying:** "We'll get you 100 leads per month!"
**We ARE saying:** "We'll get you the SAME NUMBER of leads (30/month), but 2x better quality (20% close rate instead of 10%). That's +3 customers/month instead of +3, meaning +6 total."

**Our Job:**
```
Input: 30 leads/month at 10% close rate = 3 new customers/month
Our value: Filter leads to 20% close rate = 6 new customers/month
Result: +3 new customers per month, same lead volume
```

### **Step 3: Calculate Revenue Impact**

**Formula:**
```
ADDITIONAL_REVENUE = (Additional Customers × AOV) × 12 months × Retention Rate
```

**Example:**
```
Supplier: $1.5M ARR, 3 customers/month, $10,417 AOV, 80% retention

Current revenue from new customers:
  3 new/month × $10,417 = $31,251/month
  × 12 months × 80% retention = $299,412/year from new customers

With our platform (2x close rate):
  6 new/month × $10,417 = $62,502/month
  × 12 months × 80% retention = $598,824/year from new customers

ADDITIONAL REVENUE = $598,824 - $299,412 = $299,412/year

We just added $299K to their top line.
```

### **Step 4: The Reality Check (Honesty About Expectations)**

**What we tell them during onboarding:**
```
"Your current acquisition rate is 3 customers/month.
Your AOV is $10,417.
If we improve your close rate from 10% to 15% (not 20%, being conservative):

Result: +1.5 new customers per month
Revenue impact: $10,417 × 1.5 × 12 = $187,500 additional annual revenue

This is realistic and achievable with better buyer targeting.
If we hit 20% close rate: +$299K/year.

We're not promising the $299K number. We're targeting $187K conservatively.
Anything above that is upside."
```

### **Step 5: Validate Against Their Current Scale**

**Sanity check:**
```
Supplier ARR: $1,500,000
Proposed additional revenue: $299,000 (20% ARR increase)
Is this realistic? YES
  - They can handle it (facility size supports it)
  - It's not forcing them to 3x operations
  - It's a 20% boost (achievable with better targeting)

Supplier ARR: $1,500,000
Proposed additional revenue: $1,500,000 (100% ARR increase)
Is this realistic? NO
  - They'd need to 2x their team
  - They'd need to 2x their facility
  - This is risky growth, not sustainable
```

# SECTION 5: PRICING & VALUE STRUCTURE ENGINE
## "What should we charge based on value delivered?"

### **Core Principle: Revenue-Share Model, Not One-Size-Fits-All**

We don't charge the same for a $100K ARR supplier as a $1.5M ARR supplier.
We charge based on the value we create for THEM.

---

## PRICING FRAMEWORK

### **THE FORMULA:**

```
ANNUAL_FEE = (ADDITIONAL_ANNUAL_REVENUE × CAPTURE_RATE) + BASE_FEE

Where:
- ADDITIONAL_ANNUAL_REVENUE = New revenue we help them capture
- CAPTURE_RATE = % of that new revenue we keep (0-15% range)
- BASE_FEE = Fixed monthly/annual fee (covers service costs)
```

---

## PRICING BY SUPPLIER CATEGORY

### **CATEGORY A: ESTABLISHED PLAYER ($400K - $10M ARR)**

**Their situation:**
- Already generating $1M-$10M/year
- Can afford premium services
- Additional revenue potential: $200K-$500K/year (with better buyers)

**Our pricing:**
```
BASE_FEE = $2,000-$5,000/month ($24K-$60K/year)
REVENUE_CAPTURE = 10% of additional revenue created

Example: Create $300K additional revenue
  Base fee: $36K/year
  Revenue share: $300K × 10% = $30K/year
  TOTAL = $66K/year

Alternatively: 
  $5,500/month = $66K/year (all-in, no revenue share)
```

**Why this price?**
- They're sophisticated, can handle self-service portions
- We provide data + buyer targeting + reporting
- They do the closing (we measure impact)
- ROI for them: $300K added revenue / $66K cost = 4.5x ROI

---

### **CATEGORY B: GROWTH-STAGE OPERATOR ($100K - $500K ARR)**

**Their situation:**
- Growing but not yet optimized
- Budget-conscious but willing to invest in growth
- Additional revenue potential: $50K-$150K/year

**Our pricing:**
```
BASE_FEE = $1,000-$2,500/month ($12K-$30K/year)
REVENUE_CAPTURE = 12-15% of additional revenue

Example: Create $100K additional revenue
  Base fee: $18K/year
  Revenue share: $100K × 12% = $12K/year
  TOTAL = $30K/year

Alternatively:
  $2,500/month = $30K/year (all-in)
```

**Why this price?**
- They need more hands-on support (lower base, higher % share)
- We help them close deals (higher risk, higher reward)
- ROI for them: $100K / $30K = 3.3x ROI

---

### **CATEGORY C: SPECIALIST ($50K - $200K ARR)**

**Their situation:**
- Niche, high-touch business
- Limited budget for growth tools
- Additional revenue potential: $20K-$60K/year

**Our pricing:**
```
BASE_FEE = $500-$1,500/month ($6K-$18K/year)
REVENUE_CAPTURE = 15-20% of additional revenue

Example: Create $40K additional revenue
  Base fee: $12K/year
  Revenue share: $40K × 15% = $6K/year
  TOTAL = $18K/year

Alternatively:
  $1,500/month = $18K/year (all-in)
```

**Why this price?**
- They're cost-sensitive but niche-dominant
- We do more of the work (higher % capture)
- ROI for them: $40K / $18K = 2.2x ROI

---

### **CATEGORY D: EMERGING OPERATOR ($10K - $100K ARR)**

**Their situation:**
- Pre-PMF or just launching
- Very budget-constrained
- Additional revenue potential: $5K-$20K/year

**Our pricing:**
```
BASE_FEE = $0-$500/month ($0-$6K/year)
REVENUE_CAPTURE = 20-30% of additional revenue

Example: Create $15K additional revenue
  Base fee: $0/year (or $250/month = $3K/year)
  Revenue share: $15K × 25% = $3.75K/year
  TOTAL = $3.75K-$6.75K/year

Alternatively:
  $300-$500/month if they prefer fixed (more affordable)
```

**Why this price?**
- They can't afford high fees yet
- We take on more risk (higher % capture)
- ROI for them: $15K / $5K = 3x ROI
- This is growth-stage pricing; they graduate to Category B/C as they scale

---

## PRICING SELECTION FRAMEWORK

**Decision Tree for Each Supplier:**

```
IF supplier ARR ≥ $400K AND cash position = healthy:
  → Use CATEGORY A pricing (Base + 10% revenue share)
  
IF supplier ARR = $100K-$500K AND growing:
  → Use CATEGORY B pricing (Base + 12-15% revenue share)
  
IF supplier ARR < $200K AND highly specialized:
  → Use CATEGORY C pricing (Base + 15-20% revenue share)
  
IF supplier ARR < $100K AND pre-PMF:
  → Use CATEGORY D pricing (Base + 20-30% revenue share or fixed monthly)
  
IF supplier wants "all-in" fixed fee (no revenue share):
  → Combine base + revenue share into single monthly fee
  → Example: $1,500/month = $18K/year
```

---

# SECTION 6: SUCCESS THRESHOLD ENGINE
## "How do we measure if we're succeeding for THIS supplier?"

### **Core Principle: 2x Revenue Impact in First 90 Days**

Success = We help them acquire 2x their normal monthly customers
(Not necessarily 2x total revenue immediately, but pathway clear)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS BY STAGE

### **STAGE 1: ONBOARDING (Weeks 1-4)**

**Questions we MUST answer:**

1. **"How many customers are you acquiring per month currently?"**
   - We ask directly: "In a normal month, how many new customers do you close?"
   - Industry range: 1-5 for most packaging SMBs
   - This is their BASELINE
   - Resistance expected: "We don't track that precisely" → We estimate from LinkedIn, import/export

2. **"What's your average order value?"**
   - We calculate from: ARR / annual customers acquired
   - Industry range: $2,000-$25,000 for packaging
   - Example: $1.5M ARR / 144 customers/year = $10,417 AOV

3. **"What's your current lead-to-customer conversion rate?"**
   - We assume 10% unless they tell us otherwise
   - Better operators may be 15-20%
   - Poor operators may be 5-8%
   - We estimate from: (Current customers per month) / (Estimated leads per month)

**Onboarding Output: Their Baseline Profile**
```
Example Supplier:
- Current customers/month: 3
- AOV: $10,417
- Estimated lead volume: 30/month (at 10% conversion)
- Annual revenue from new customers: $375,012 (3 × $10,417 × 12)
```

---

### **STAGE 2: EARLY MOMENTUM (Months 1-3)**

**Success Threshold: +2 new customers per month**
```
Baseline: 3 customers/month
Target: 5 customers/month
Revenue impact: +2 × $10,417 = +$20,834/month = +$250K/year

This is 17% ARR growth from new customers alone.
Industry standard: Achievable with better targeting.
```

**How we achieve it:**
1. Identify 50 buyer prospects in their sweet-spot (MOV to 2x AOV)
2. Qualify for buyer fit (industry, size, buying pattern)
3. Deliver intro calls + connection management
4. Track: Leads delivered, meetings scheduled, deals closed

**Success metric: ≥ 1.5 new customers/month (75% of +2 target)**

---

### **STAGE 3: SUSTAINED GROWTH (Months 3-12)**

**Success Threshold: Maintain +1.5 to +2 new customers/month**
```
Target: 4.5-5 total customers/month
Revenue impact: $18.75K-$20.8K additional/month = $225K-$250K/year
```

**How we maintain it:**
1. Monthly reporting: Leads, conversion %, revenue attributed
2. Quarterly strategy reviews: Are we hitting their AOV? Need to adjust targeting?
3. Scaling: If they're at 5 customers/month, move to next tier (targeting 7-10)

**Success metric: Consistent 4-5 new customers/month for 3+ months**

---

### **STAGE 4: EXPANSION (Year 2+)**

**Success Threshold: 1.5-2x baseline (from initial 3 to 5-6 customers/month)**
```
Revenue impact: +2-3 customers/month = $25K-$31K/month = $300K-$375K/year
```

**How we achieve it:**
1. Expand into underserved verticals (Roof 1 analysis shows gaps)
2. Increase AOV (move from $10K average to $15K average)
3. Optimize deal sizing (20% on $5K, 50% on $10-$15K, 20% on $25K, 10% on $50K+)

**Success metric: 50% ARR growth from new customer acquisition**

---

## HANDLING UNDERPERFORMANCE

**If at Month 2 we're seeing <1 new customer/month:**

```
Possible reasons:
1. Our buyer targeting is off (fix: refine buyer profile)
2. Their conversion rate is worse than 10% (fix: help with sales process)
3. Their industry is seasonal (fix: time-adjust targets)
4. Their product doesn't match buyers we're finding (fix: reposition product)

Our response:
- Month 2 check-in: "We're tracking 0.5 customers/month. Here's what we're learning..."
- Pivot: Adjust buyer profile, messaging, or deal sizing
- By Month 3: Should see improvement to 1+ customers/month
- If still stuck: Review if fit is right (may need to sunset partnership)
```

---

## SUCCESS TIERS (Based on ARR Growth from Our Service)

| Tier | ARR Growth | Examples | Action |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **🟢 Success** | 15%+ YoY | 3→5 customers/month, $250K new revenue | Renew, expand to bigger deals |
| **🟡 Adequate** | 8-15% YoY | 3→4 customers/month, $125K new revenue | Optimize targeting, hold pricing |
| **🔴 Below Target** | <8% YoY | <1.5 new customers/month, <$100K new revenue | 30-day optimization window, then review |
| **⚫ Not Fit** | <0.5 customers/month | No traction despite adjustments | Sunset with grace, offer recommendations |

# SECTION 8: THE BRAIN'S ONBOARDING PLAYBOOK
## "How we actually use this on Day 1 with a supplier"

### **Onboarding Conversation Flow (30 minutes)**

**We say:**
```
"Welcome! Here's what we do:
1. We pull intelligence on your business (what kind of company you are)
2. We figure out what KIND of buyers would love you
3. We find those buyers and connect you
4. We measure success by revenue we help you create

To get started, I have 3 critical questions. Some we already know from public data,
but I want to hear from you directly:

Question 1: In a normal month, how many new customers do you close?
(We're trying to establish your baseline. No judgment. Just reality.)

Question 2: What's your average deal size?
(Again, we can estimate from your website, but you know better.)

Question 3: What's the breakdown of where your customers come from?
(Inbound, referrals, cold outreach? This tells us what's working for you.)

Now, here's what we learned about you:
- You're a [Established/Growth-stage/Specialist/Emerging] player
- Your buyer profile appears to be [Industry] companies, size [SMB/Mid-market], with [pain point]
- Your sweet-spot deal size is [$X MOV] to [$Y AOV] to [$Z max]
- With better targeting, we think we can get you [+X] new customers per month

Does that resonate?

Great. Our pricing for you:

Success looks like:
- Month 1: Qualifying 30 buyer prospects
- Month 2-3: +1-2 new customers/month
- Month 4+: +2-3 new customers/month sustained

Ready to start?"
