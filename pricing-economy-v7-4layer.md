# SUPPLIER INTELLIGENCE PRICING & ECONOMY v7
## Tiered Pricing Based on "The 4 Layers"

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Shift:**
We are abandoning the flat-rate SaaS model ($299-$499).
We are moving to a **Value-Based Intelligence Model ($299 - $1,299+)**.

**Why:**
- **Layer 1 (Discovery)** is a commodity. Cheap.
- **Layer 2 (Competitor Intel)** is a strategic weapon. Expensive.
- **Layer 3 (Derived Demand)** is predictive revenue. High Value.
- **Layer 4 (Urgency)** is immediate transaction capability. High Value.

**Target Audience:**
- **Type B/C Suppliers ($500K - $10M Revenue):** They don't want a "tool". They want **deals**. They pay for **unfair advantage**.
- **Willingness to Pay:** If one deal = $50k/year revenue, paying $15k/year ($1,299/mo) is a no-brainer (30x ROI).

## UNIT ECONOMICS & PROFITABILITY (Year 1)

### Assumptions
- **Apify/Data Costs:** Scale with usage, but stay low relative to price.
- **Churn:** 5% (Improved due to high value "sticky" Layer 2/3 features).
- **Mix:** 
  - Tier 1: 40%
  - Tier 2: 30%
  - Tier 3: 20%
  - Tier 4: 10%

### Cost Per Supplier (At Scale - Month 12)
- **Apify/Scraping:** ~$15/mo (Heavy usage on Tier 4).
- **Paid Data APIs (ImportGenius etc):** ~$50/mo (Amortized across users).
- **Cloud Infra:** ~$5/mo.
- **Support:** ~$30/mo.
- **TOTAL COST:** **~$100/mo** (Conservative).

### Margins
- **Tier 1 ($299):** $199 Profit (66% Margin).

## ROI JUSTIFICATION (The Sales Pitch to Suppliers)

**The Math for a Type B Supplier ($2M Revenue):**
- **Average Deal Size:** $50,000 / year (recurring packaging orders).
- **Tier 4 Cost:** $15,600 / year.

**Scenario:**
- The "Urgency Score" identifies 1 buyer whose current supplier just had a factory fire (Competitor Intel).
- You pitch immediately.
- You win the deal.
- **Revenue:** +$50,000.
- **Cost:** -$15,600.
- **Net Profit:** +$34,400 (First year).
- **ROI:** **320%**.

*And that's just ONE deal. If they win 4 deals? ROI is 1200%.*

## CHURN REDUCTION STRATEGY

**Why they won't leave:**
1. **The "Competitor Trap":** Once they start monitoring a competitor (Layer 2), turning it off feels like "flying blind". They are addicted to knowing where the enemy is.
2. **The "Urgency Feed":** Sales teams build their daily workflow around the "High Urgency" list. Removing it breaks their process.
3. **Data History:** "If I leave, I lose the history of my competitor's shipment patterns."
